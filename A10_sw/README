kernel_patches contains changes to kernel.
kernel is a copy of the Altera Angstrom kernel source.

kernel_patches/arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_arria10_swvp.dts has been modified to add
a number of user HW elements instantiated in the FPGA fabric.
Run kernel/setup.sh to rebuild the kernel
Run kernel/linux-socfpga/make
Run buildsocvpelf/run.txt to recreate the elf image.

User program examples accessing custom HW elements are under jpeg and imagecapture dirs.
