kernel_patches contains changes to kernel.
kernel is a copy of the Altera Angstrom kernel source.

kernel_patches/arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_arria10_swvp.dts has been modified to add
a number of user HW elements instantiated in the FPGA fabric.

Makefile in this directory will rebuild the kernel and the elf image based on changes
under kernel_patches.

The prebuilt filesystem is fetched from the Altera Rocketboard ftp site.

For instructions on how to build a filesytem from scratch, please refer to:
https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/view/Documentation/AlteraArria10SoCVirtualPlatformBuildLinux

User program examples accessing custom HW elements are under ../fpga_sw:
  jpegcpp: Uses fpga jpeg encode block
  imagecapture: Captures image from host camera
  imagedisplay: Modifies and displays original image and modified image
